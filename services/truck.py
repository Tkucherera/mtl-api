"""
Goals for this module:
- Define a Truck class to represent truck entities.
- Implement methods for truck operations (e.g., get truck info).
- Ensure data validation and integrity.
- Functionality to associate trucks with trips and drivers.
- Fucntions to know truck availability based on trip schedules.
- Fucntions to update truck status (e.g., in service, under maintenance).
- Functions for knowing truck history (past trips, maintenance records).
- Functions to update truck location (if GPS data is available).
- Integration with database for persistent storage.
